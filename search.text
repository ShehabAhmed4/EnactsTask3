The display property in CSS is used to define how an element should be displayed.

inline: Makes the element an inline element, meaning it will flow with the surrounding content.

inline-block: Similar to inline, but allows setting width and height values.

flex: Enables a flex container, allowing you to use the flexbox layout.
